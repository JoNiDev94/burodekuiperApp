Query works for POSt request --> order still messy

Abandoned DR recovery for the moment as it has to be done on DB level

Johanna JSON text1 is missing the right layout (enter etc)


TODO:

1. Convert text to DB in good layout (add /n etc) DONE
2. Disaster recovery
    Disaster recovery is not working, it will only work if entire app.js runs on same server and gets 1 or 0 from DB for DR, postpone this to enhancement instead of requirement
3. Clean-up unnecessary code and improve structure
4. Load entire app on a real webhosting server --> db setup for on own domain


bugs:

1. post cant be carried out twice
